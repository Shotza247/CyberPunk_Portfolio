# GitHub Project Board

## Project Name

MongoDB RAG Profile Agent

## Project Description

Build a reproducible document-to-vector-search and grounded-answer system for the Profile Assistant/Profile Agent. The project starts with a local MongoDB Vector Search test UI, then adds reranking, LLM answer generation, and finally a production-ready API that can power the portfolio assistant.
