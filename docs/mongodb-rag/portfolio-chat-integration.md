# Portfolio Chat Integration

Status: backend implementation is in progress; integration is not accepted. FastAPI
POST `/api/ask` and the Vercel entry point exist. The answer workflow now requests a
typed `GroundedAnswer` schema, but its focused tests and post-fix live request are
pending. The portfolio still uses its local keyword matcher; the API is not deployed
and browser integration has not passed acceptance. See `project-status.md` for the
current handoff and `templates/document-vector-pipeline/PIPELINE_AUDIT.md` for the
chronological failure/fix record.

## Request Contract

The static portfolio sends the visitor's question to the configured RAG API base URL at POST /api/ask with JSON fields query, top_k, and min_score. The API base URL is public configuration, not a secret.

Never include a MongoDB URI, model API key, or shared secret in HTML/JavaScript. Do not pass database or collection overrides from the browser. The deployed API must restrict this route to the reviewed public profile collection.

Successful responses contain answer, citations, and insufficient_evidence. Render the answer and structured citations from the response; citations resolve evidence IDs to trusted source ID, chunk ID, title/section, and vector/rerank scores. Avoid exposing raw diagnostics to visitors.

## LLM Answer Acceptance

The website needs the grounded LLM response from /api/ask, not just retrieved or
reranked chunks. Configure CHAT_PROVIDER and CHAT_MODEL on the backend and keep its
API key server-side. Voyage is used for embeddings/reranking; it is not a generative
chat model. The adapter supports OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI/Grok, and DeepSeek when the
corresponding optional package and provider credentials are installed.

Before connecting the website, invoke /api/ask with the intended provider and verify:

- A question requiring facts from more than one retrieved chunk receives a useful,
  concise synthesis grounded only in those chunks.
- Inline evidence markers match the returned citation IDs and resolve to the exact
  source_id/chunk_id/title/section supplied as evidence.
- No-match questions return insufficient_evidence with no citations.
- Invalid model output and provider/network errors return a controlled API error;
  the browser displays a retryable message and does not expose exception details.
- At least one real invocation is recorded for every provider described as tested.
  An adapter import or key-presence diagnostic alone is not provider verification.

## Website Behavior

- Show loading and prevent duplicate submission while a request is in flight.
- Support Enter submission and preserve keyboard/accessibility behavior.
- Show the answer with source title/section citations.
- For insufficient evidence, show the cautious answer and no invented citations.
- On timeout, network, provider, or malformed-response errors, show a retry action.
- If local keyword fallback is used, label it as a local answer; never present it as RAG output.
- Send only the question and supported retrieval options. Do not silently persist visitor questions.

## Deployment Boundary

Deploy MongoDB RAG as a separate Vercel project rooted at the RAG repository, using its existing api/index.py, pyproject.toml, and vercel.json. Deploy the static portfolio independently. Point portfolio preview to API preview; production points to production API.

Set MongoDB, embedding, reranker, and chat-provider secrets in the RAG Vercel project's server-side environment settings. Keep them out of portfolio code and browser bundles.

Before browser calls, add exact portfolio preview and production origins to FastAPI CORS middleware. CORS controls browser access but is not authentication: also enforce request/time limits, rate/abuse controls, and a server-side database target allowlist. Do not embed a static API token in public JavaScript.

The current vercel.json excludes development files. It is not itself a deployment, secret-management, CORS, or auth configuration. Measure /api/ask duration in preview before setting a function-duration override.

## Acceptance Gates

1. Local API: real configured chat-model invocation; multi-chunk synthesis; valid citations; insufficient evidence; malformed output; provider error.
2. Vercel preview: status, MongoDB access, search/rerank/ask, citation shape, timeout, bundle size, and function duration.
3. Browser preview: CORS, answer, citations, no-context response, offline/error fallback labeling, retry, keyboard, and mobile layout.
4. Production: confirm exact origins and environment values, then repeat essential answer/citation/error checks.

Do not mark website chat complete until preview and production results are recorded in the portfolio roadmap and RAG audit.
